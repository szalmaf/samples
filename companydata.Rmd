## Crunchbase data prep

This repo contains a sample dashboard that looks at venture capital follow on trends and uses sparkcharts to show follow-on trends in number of investments and by series.

The data comes from a crunchbase excel export from 2014 (unfortunately crunchbase api is no longer public so this dataset cannot be updated) and was loaded into a sqlite database with the following process:

xlsx2csv "crunchbase_monthly_export_d43b44299ade53.xlsx" -s 3 companies.csv
xlsx2csv "crunchbase_monthly_export_d43b44299ade53.xlsx" -s 3 rounds.csv
xlsx2csv "crunchbase_monthly_export_d43b44299ade53.xlsx" -s 3 investmets.csv
xlsx2csv "crunchbase_monthly_export_d43b44299ade53.xlsx" -s 3 acquisitions.csv
